"The Lidar Tile Maker Plugin has been developed in order to make easier "
"the use of the CHM from Lidar Plugin. The latter has been developed by "
"Gter srl and funded by the 'Programma di sviluppo rurale per il Veneto "
"2014-2020' - Regione del Veneto - Direzione AdG FEASR e Foreste. It "
"allows to compute the Canopy Height Model (CHM) starting from Lidar data,"
" in particular Digital Surface Model (DSM)  and Digital Terrain Model "
"(DTM)."

#: ../../intro.rst:25
msgid ""
"The use of CHM from LIDAR plugin is based on a Tile Vector Layer which is"
" automatically uploaded to the working Qgis project when the plugin icon "
"is pressed. By default the tile vector layer, named "
"**tile_dsm_dtm.gpkg**, contains data of Regione Veneto (Italy) which has "
"founded its development. Obviously the **tile_dsm_dtm** layer can be "
"modified by user including its own data."

#: ../../intro.rst:27
msgid ""
"The **Lidar Tile Maker** Plugin allows users to create their own Tile "
"Vector Layer with all the characteristics requested by the CHM from LIDAR"
" Plugin. For instance, the plugin creates a **tile_dsm_dtm.gpkg** with "
"all the necessary information stored in the attribute table. The table "
"fields are automatically created and named so as to be used by the CHM "
"from LIDAR Plugin."
