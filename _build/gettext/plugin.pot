msgid "The **Lidar Tile Maker** Plugin creates the tile vector layer, named *tile_dsm_dtm*, to be used as input for the CHM from LIDAR Plugin. As already mentioned in the introduction of the manual, the CHM from LIDAR plugin automatically uploads and uses the *tile_dsm_dtm* vector layer, which contains data of Regione Veneto, but it can be replaced with the one created by the **Lidar Tile Maker** Plugin. It creates a GeoPackage file, automatically named *tile_dsm_dtm.gpkg*, which contains the polygons of tiles computed from the extensions of the DTM/DSM file given by users as input. Also the related attribute table is automatically created with all the required fields and filled with all the necessary information taken from input parameters provided by users or from the data themselves. The fields of the attribute table of the *tile_dsm_dtm.gpkg* file are:"

The **Lidar Tile Maker** Plugin computes the extension of each DTM tile and of its related DSM tile given as input. If the two tiles, DTM and related DSM, have the same extension, the plugin creates the tile polygon. The final output is a vector layer containing all the polygons corresponding to the extension of each tile DTM/DSM given as input. The plugin creates the corresponding tile polygon only if both DTM and DSM exist and if they have the same extension. Otherwise the tool returns a warning message."
